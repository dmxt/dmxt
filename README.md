Hello! I’m Dana. I'm an UX/UI designer with development skills. I live in Miami for eleven years, ten years in Seattle, and before that I traveled the world.

# About me
I have over 19 years of experience in design and a little bit less in development. I take pride in the exceptional work I have accomplished, and my portfolio serves as a testament to my skills. I have an OCD it helped me to enhance the quality of my work. I love reading books about design.

### Design
My professional journey began in 2009 when I started designing as a hobby, by 2014 I became a professional designer and web developer. My expertise is user experience & interface (UIX) design for sites, logotype & branding, and app design for mobile and desktop.

### Web Development
I specialize in front-end development, proficient in languages such as HTML, SASS, PHP, JavaScript, React, Python, and WordPress theming. I also have experience in other engines like Shopify. Additionally, I’ve created a few web browser extensions. 

### Hosting
I primarily use AWS, DigitalOcean, and Netlify, all managed through the command line. I'm familiar with an online cPanel-style hosting site, but prefer command-line or Netlify for more seamless DevOps production pipeline.

### Teaching
During my tenure as a tutor from 2014 to 2017, I worked with my student/friend Michael, who initially lacked any basic computer knowledge. He demonstrated exceptional motivation and utilized a 9-inch Windows netbook for his studies. After three years of dedicated tutoring, Michael transitioned into freelance work as a web designer and developer on a Macbook. He's now a CTO for the company he's working for. I have documented my experiences and insights in a [blog post](https://medium.com/@dmxt/mentoring-a-student-who-is-a-computer-casual-to-a-designer-front-end-developer-79cb16afc42f).
