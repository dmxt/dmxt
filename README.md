ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Dana. I live in Miami, FL ðŸŒ´ for nine years now, I used to live in Seattle, WA ðŸŒ§ for ten years, and I've traveled around the world in my earlier life.

#### About myself
I pride myself on the excellent jobs I've done, and my portfolio will speak for itself. I have an OCD that contributed to the quality of my visual design work. I read every book regarding usability and user experience. I learned that all UX design studies for basic physical objects apply to an app user experience. I now have 17 years of experience in my belt.

#### Design
How I got started: I've been practicing as a hobby in 2006, by 2009 I started working professionally on design and web development: logotype, UX design, UI design, and app design for iOS, Android, and a desktop.

I started freelancing in 2014. 

When I got hired as a contractor in 2016, I was among the first to design an Android app in Google Material while it was in the Alpha phrase. Android phones didn't use it at the time. I never thought it would be still up to date today, seven years later.

#### Web Development
I write front-end development language very well: HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap framework, some JavaScript, React, Python, and theming for WordPress and other site builders. I also wrote a few web browser extensions. In addition, I can handle AWS, DigitalOcean, and a command line for hosting.

#### My startup experience
I created a startup as a "co-founder" in 2015, my task was design and front-end development. Before the launch, many people flocked to it saying how beautiful it looked.

Only two days after the public launch, we received a cease & desist letter and got sued for 3 million dollars by RIAA, Sony, and other companies in interest. If you're curious, there are five or six articles about us, here's a [final article](https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-and-aurous-settle-piracy-lawsuit-for-3-million-151209/) that concluded the startup. 

I just moved to USA as an adult, I didn't know the laws very well. Few years later, I found out I was not registered as a co-founder. It is still one of my best design work.

#### My experience as a teacher
I've tutored my friend, Michael from 2014 to 2017. He had zero knowledge of computer, he didn't even know how to use it, but he was very motivated. After 3 years, he started freelancing as a web designer and developer. He's doing very well now. I made a [blog article](https://medium.com/@dmxt/mentoring-a-student-who-is-a-computer-casual-to-a-designer-front-end-developer-79cb16afc42f) about it. 

#### Personal hobby projects
I'm writing a blog system on the Gatsby engine while studying in-depth React. I've deployed the Gatsby blog to my site on a functional DevOps pipeline. I can commit straight from my computer, and it will auto-build and update the online version for visitors. I also have been working on a few programming projects that interested me.

Once you start programming, you can't stop.
