ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Dana. I live in Miami, FL ðŸŒ´ for nine years now, I used to live in Seattle, WA ðŸŒ§ for ten years, and I've traveled around the world in my earlier life.

#### Design
How I got started: I've been practicing professionally and as a hobby since 2006 on design and web development: logotype, UX design, UI design, and app design for iOS, Android, and a desktop.

I started freelancing in 2014.

When I got hired as a contractor, I was among the first to design an Android app in Google Material while it was in the pre-release alpha phase in 2015. This guideline is still up to date seven years later.

#### Development
I write front-end development, including HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap framework, some JavaScript, React, Python, and theming for website builders. I also wrote a few web browser extensions. In addition, I can handle AWS, DigitalOcean, and a command line.

#### Personal projects
I'm writing a blog system on the Gatsby engine while studying in-depth React. I've deployed the Gatsby blog to my site on a functional DevOps pipeline. I can commit straight from my computer, and it will auto-build and update the online version for visitors. I've been working on a few programming projects that interested me.

#### About myself
I pride myself on the excellent jobs I've done, and my portfolio will speak for itself. I have an OCD that contributed to the quality of my visual design work. I read every book regarding usability and user experience. I learned that all UX design studies for basic physical objects apply to an app user experience.

I now have 17 years of experience in my belt.
