Hello! I‚Äôm Dana. I'm an UX/UI designer with development skills. I spent eleven years in Miami, ten years in Seattle, and before that, I traveled the world.

# About me
I have over 17 years of experience in design and a little bit less in development. I take pride in the exceptional work I have accomplished, and my portfolio serves as a testament to my skills. I have an OCD and it's my significant role in enhancing the quality of my work. I have read a lot of books on design.

### Design
My professional journey began in 2009 when I started designing as a hobby, by 2014 I became a professional designer and web developer. My expertise is user experience & interface (UIX) design for sites, logotype & branding, and app design for iOS, Android, desktop platforms.

#### One of the first Google Material app designer
While Android was still on Gingerbread operating system and Android did not incorporate Google Material into their own applications, I was hired as a contractor in 2016 and was one of the first designer to design an app utilizing Google Material with studies of the alpha design guidelines. 10 years later, the app design is still up-to-date without any modifications.

### Web Development
I specialize in front-end development, proficient in languages such as HTML, SASS, PHP, JavaScript, React, Python, and WordPress theming. I also have experience in other engines like Shopify. Additionally, I‚Äôve created a few web browser extensions. 

### Hosting
I primarily use AWS, DigitalOcean, and Netlify, all managed through the command line. I'm familiar with an online cPanel-style hosting site, but prefer command-line for more seamless DevOps cycle.

## My startup
In 2015, I co-founded the startup ‚ÄúAurous‚Äù and was responsible for designing and front-end development. Prior to its launch, the website garnered significant attention for its aesthetically pleasing design. Notably, it remains one of my most accomplished design projects. However, just two days after its public launch, we received a cease and desist letter and were subsequently sued for $3 million by RIAA, Sony, and other entities interested in the content

## My experience as a mentor
During my tenure as a tutor from 2014 to 2017, I worked with my friend Michael, who lacked prior computer knowledge. Despite this, he demonstrated exceptional motivation and utilized a limited 9-inch Windows netbook for his studies. After three years of dedicated tutoring, Michael transitioned into freelance work as a web designer and developer. His remarkable progress led him to replace his old netbook with a MacBook Pro for his professional endeavors. I have documented my experiences and insights in a blog post titled ‚Äú[Blog Article](https://medium.com/@dmxt/mentoring-a-student-who-is-a-computer-casual-to-a-designer-front-end-developer-79cb16afc42f)‚Äù.
