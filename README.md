üëã Hi! I'm Dana. I live in Miami, FL üå¥ for nine years now, I used to live in Seattle, WA üåß for ten years, and I've traveled around the world in my earlier life.

### About myself
I pride myself on the excellent jobs I've done, and my portfolio will speak for itself. I have an OCD that contributed to the quality of my visual design work. I read a lot of books regarding usability and user experience. I learned that all UX design studies for basic physical objects apply to an user experience. I now have 17 years of experience in my belt.

#### Design
How I got started: I've been practicing as a hobby in 2006, by 2009 I started working professionally on design and web development: logotype, UX design, UI design, and app design for iOS, Android, and a desktop. I started freelancing in 2014.

When I got hired as a contractor in 2016, I was among the first to design an Android app in Google Material while it was in the Alpha phrase. Android phones didn't use it at the time. Google Material is still up to date today in 2023.

#### Web Development
I write front-end development language very well: HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap framework, some JavaScript, React, Python, and theming for WordPress and other site builders. I also wrote a few web browser extensions. In addition, I can handle AWS, DigitalOcean, and a command line for hosting.

#### My startup experience
I created a startup called "Aurous" as a co-founder in 2015, my task was design and front-end development. Before the launch, many people flocked to it saying how beautiful it looked. It is still one of my best design work. Only two days after the public launch, we received a cease & desist letter and got sued for 3 million dollars by RIAA, Sony, and other companies in interest, I had to go to the federal court and it concluded just fine.

#### My experience as a teacher
I've tutored my friend, Michael from 2014 to 2017. He had zero knowledge of computer, he didn't even know how to use it, but he was very motivated. After 3 years, he started freelancing as a web designer and developer. He's doing very well now. I made a [blog article](https://medium.com/@dmxt/mentoring-a-student-who-is-a-computer-casual-to-a-designer-front-end-developer-79cb16afc42f) about it.
