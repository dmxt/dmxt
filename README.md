ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dana living in Miami, FL ðŸŒ´ for eight years, and I used to live in Seattle, WA ðŸŒ§ for ten years. 

I've been practicing professionally and as a hobby since 2006 on multiple designs: logotype, UX/UI, iOS/Android, and Desktop apps. I was one of the first to design an Android app in Google Material while it was in the pre-release beta phase in 2015, and this guideline is still up to date today.

I also do front-end development gigs, including HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap framework, and theming for website builders, and I also wrote an extension for Chrome. I'm writing a new blog on the Gatsby engine (85% completed as of writing) and studying in-depth React.

I pride myself on the excellent jobs I've done, and my portfolio will speak for itself. I have an OCD that contributed to the quality of the design work I put out.
