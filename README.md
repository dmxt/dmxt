Hey there! I’m Dana. I'm an UX/UI designer with some development skills. I spent eleven years in Miami, ten years in Seattle, and before that, I traveled the world.

### About myself
I take pride in the exceptional work I have accomplished, and my portfolio serves as a testament to my skills. My obsessive-compulsive disorder has played a significant role in enhancing the quality of my visual design work. I have dedicated myself to extensive reading on usability and user experience, which has greatly contributed to my expertise. With over 17 years of experience in the field, I am confident in my abilities.

#### Design
My professional journey began in 2009 when I transitioned from a hobbyist to a professional designer and web developer. My expertise encompasses logotype design, user experience (UX) design, user interface (UI) design, and application design for iOS, Android, and desktop platforms. I embarked on my freelance career in 2014.

When I was hired as a contractor in 2016, I was one of the first to design an Android app using Google Material, even though Google Material was still in the Alpha phase at the time, while Android itself didn’t use Google Material. The design I created over eight years ago is still relevant and up-to-date today.

#### Web Development
I specialize in front-end development, proficient in languages such as HTML, SASS, PHP, JavaScript, React, Python, and WordPress theming. I also have experience in other engines like Shopify. Additionally, I’ve created a few web browser extensions. 

#### Hosting
I primarily use AWS, DigitalOcean, and Netlify, all managed through the command line. Additionally, I’ve become familiar with an online cPanel-style hosting site.

### My startup
In 2015, I co-founded the startup “Aurous” and was responsible for designing and front-end development. Prior to its launch, the website garnered significant attention for its aesthetically pleasing design. Notably, it remains one of my most accomplished design projects. However, just two days after its public launch, we received a cease and desist letter and were subsequently sued for $3 million by RIAA, Sony, and other entities interested in the content

### My experience as a mentor
During my tenure as a tutor from 2014 to 2017, I worked with my friend Michael, who lacked prior computer knowledge. Despite this, he demonstrated exceptional motivation and utilized a limited 9-inch Windows netbook for his studies. After three years of dedicated tutoring, Michael transitioned into freelance work as a web designer and developer. His remarkable progress led him to replace his old netbook with a MacBook Pro for his professional endeavors. I have documented my experiences and insights in a blog post titled “[Blog Article](https://medium.com/@dmxt/mentoring-a-student-who-is-a-computer-casual-to-a-designer-front-end-developer-79cb16afc42f)”. 

### My portfolio
My new website is currently in a state of development. So far, I have established a functional production pipeline.
